Final Project Repository for Web Systems Programming
    Learn the basics:
    a. Familiarize yourself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you haven't already.
    b. Study the canvas API, which will be used to render your game graphics.

   Set up your development environment:
    a. Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
    b. Set up version control using Git and a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

   Plan your game:
    a. Decide on the game's theme, characters, levels, and goals.
    b. Sketch out a rough design of the game levels and characters.

   Create the game structure:
    a. Set up an HTML file with a canvas element and link to your JavaScript and CSS files.
    b. Create separate JavaScript files for different game components like characters, levels, and physics.

   Develop the game engine:
    a. Implement the game loop using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.
    b. Create a basic physics system to handle character movement, gravity, and collisions.
    c. Implement keyboard input for character control.

   Design game assets:
    a. Create or source sprites and tilesets for characters, backgrounds, and platforms.
    b. Optimize the assets for performance and use a sprite atlas if necessary.

   Implement game elements:
    a. Add the player character with animations for walking, jumping, and other actions.
    b. Create the platforms and other interactive elements like enemies, power-ups, and obstacles.
    c. Implement a camera system to follow the player and display the level.

   Build levels and game progression:
    a. Design and create levels using the assets and game elements you've developed.
    b. Implement level progression and save points or checkpoints.
    c. Add a scoring or point system to track player progress.

   Polish and optimize:
    a. Test your game for bugs and performance issues.
    b. Optimize the code and assets for better performance, if necessary.
    c. Add sounds and music to enhance the game experience.

   Deploy and share your game:
    a. Package your game for distribution using a web server or a platform like itch.io.
    b. Share your game with friends, family, or the online community for feedback and support.

   Iterate and expand:
    a. Continuously improve your game based on feedback and your own observations.
    b. Add more levels, features, or game modes to keep players engaged.
